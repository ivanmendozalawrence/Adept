A.D.E.P.T.: An Automated Data Exchange &amp; Predictive Trust system for B2B open banking ecosystem.

Our "Proactive Trust & Collaboration Integrity System" is an AI-powered platform for B2B Open Banking. It leverages Decentralized Identities (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) for secure, automated partner onboarding and continuous due diligence. An integrated Predictive AI module monitors "Collaboration Health" by analyzing verifiable credentials, API usage, data consistency, and workflow performance. This AI identifies emerging risks and inefficiencies before they escalate into disputes or compliance breaches.
The system will:
Automate Trust: DIDs/VCs for instant, auditable verification of partner licenses, security, and compliance policies, replacing manual checks.
Predictive Oversight: AI continuously assesses partnership health, flagging data inconsistencies or workflow bottlenecks across integrated systems.
Proactive Interventions: Provides Alistair with actionable insights to address issues early, safeguarding financial operations.
Our high-level plan involves developing a modular platform, starting with core DID/VC integration, followed by the AI health monitoring. We'll leverage existing API standards where possible. This empowers MSMEs by lowering trust barriers for collaboration and promotes fairness through transparent, verifiable compliance.

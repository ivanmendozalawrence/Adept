Centralized asset exports

Usage example:
import { Logo, LogoWhiteText } from '../assets';

Note: Physical image files currently remain at the src root to avoid breaking any un-migrated imports. They can be moved into this folder (e.g., src/assets/images) later; update index.js paths accordingly.
